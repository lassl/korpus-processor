# Simple Korean Corpus Pre-Processors
## on-going...
## TODO
1. Support cleansing (removing press tags, reporter info. etc.) of open-source Korean corpus
2. Support filtering-out for processing a set of uniformly distributed corpus
3. Ready-to-use main file (including file I/O, functions above etc.)

## Possible Usage
1. Building a less-biased corpus in terms of domain
2. Building a uniformly distributed Korean docs index for retrieval
